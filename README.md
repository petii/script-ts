# `<script-ts>`
A web component to be able to use typescript in simple web pages.

After seeing the announcement for [--eraseableSyntaxOnly in typescript 5.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8/#the---erasablesyntaxonly-option) it gave me the idea that maybe node should not be the only one capable of such feats.
